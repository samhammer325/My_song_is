              I am a very simple card. I am good at containing small bits of information.
              I am convenient because I require little markup to use effectively. I am similar to what is called a panel in other frameworks. Here's my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/gpsullivan">gpsullivan</a>

              This is another very simple card. I did not copy this from any website, and I actually
              just made it up on my own. I made it just as long as the previous example - except my example
              is way better. Here's my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/spencetacular">spencetacular</a>

                This is the last card example. This is going to be the longest example out of any
                of the previous entries. This is because I wanted to have it show something that was 
                bigger than the rest. The bigger - the better. Here's my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/coreyrugino">coreyrugino</a>
